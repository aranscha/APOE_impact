## Abstract
**Motivation:** It is understood that genetic variants play a crucial role in the heterogeneity of Covid-19 outcomes. Quantifying the unexplored underlying mechanisms of genetic mutations, presents a great opportunity to further elucidate the causality between the genetic variants and mortality rates from Covid-19. <br>
**Results:** We illustrate that mutations of the APOE gene in mice (APOE2,APOE4), exhibit an increased Covid-19 progression and viral loads relative to mice having the APOE3 gene. Additionally our findings suggest that APOE2,APOE4 negatively affect antiviral immunity.
